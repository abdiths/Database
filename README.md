#### This project is a simple SQL-like database implemented in the C programming language. It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with a basic database management system. The provided code is a starting point that you can extend and enhance to build a more feature-rich database system.

*To-Do List*
- [x] Database Structure
- [] Database Operations
- [] Data Storage
- [] Query Processing
- [] ...

*Saturday, 14 October 2023:*

- next is to figure out how to storage actual data [presumably badly]
- fix the "Unrecognized command 'insert foo'" bug, might have an idea
