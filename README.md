**Saturday, 14 October 2023: **
- created a skeleton for database, the front-end of the SQL compiler (parsing a string and outputting a bytecode, which then is passed to the VM that executes it)
- next is to figure out how to storage actual data [presumably badly]
- fix the "Unrecognized command 'insert foo'" bug, might have an idea
